# üóÑÔ∏è SQL-Based Analysis of Product Sales (Chinook Database)  

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  
The objective of this task was to use **SQL queries** on the **Chinook Database** to extract business insights and then visualize the results using **Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn)**.  

---

## üìå Project Overview  
The Chinook Database is a sample relational database containing information about a digital media store, including **customers, invoices, products, and regions**.  

In this task, I explored the database to answer important **business questions** such as:  
- Which products are the most popular?  
- Which regions generate the most revenue?  
- How do monthly revenue trends look over time?  
- What are the average monthly performance benchmarks?  
- Which functions rank the highest using SQL window functions?
